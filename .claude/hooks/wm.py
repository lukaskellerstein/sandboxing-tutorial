"""Window-manager abstraction shared by the Playwright hooks.

Two backends behind one surface:

  i3 (Linux)     parks windows on a throwaway workspace in the 100-120 range;
                 i3 discards those workspaces on its own once they empty out.
  yabai (macOS)  parks windows on a space labelled `playwright`, created on
                 demand and destroyed at session end if this module created it.

Every entry point degrades to a no-op when the window manager is absent or
unreachable, so a hook can never fail the tool call it is attached to.

macOS caveat: moving a window between spaces requires yabai's scripting
addition. When the SA is not loaded, yabai still exits 0 and silently does
nothing -- so `park()` re-queries and reports which windows did not land. The
caller stashes those with `stash()` (float + refocus) instead, which keeps the
window compositing and therefore keeps Playwright screencasts working.

The user must never be carried along to the scratch workspace. Sending a window
to another space does not follow it, but *focusing* one does -- so the only
dangerous step is restoring focus, and `restore_focus()` will not name a target
until it has re-queried it and found it on a space that is already visible.

A space is scratch only while it holds nothing but Playwright browsers. The
label is invisible (sketchybar draws app icons, not labels), the space is an
ordinary desktop, and once the browser is closed it looks empty -- so sooner or
later the user opens a terminal there and it becomes *their* workspace. If the
hook kept treating it as scratch, every browser on the machine would be parked
into that workspace, a browser opened *from* it would never move at all, and
`focus_token()` would refuse the space as "home" and walk the user off their own
desktop on every navigation. Measured 2026-08-18: space 12 labelled `playwright`,
two Ghostty windows on it, exactly those symptoms. So `_remembered_index()`
re-checks the space for foreign windows on every run and abandons it -- label
cleared, state forgotten -- the moment one appears; a new scratch is created and
the browsers already there move along.

Ownership has two grains. `is_playwright_browser()` says "spawned by *some*
Playwright" and is enough for parking, which is harmless across sessions.
Closing is not: several Claude Code sessions run at once on this machine, each
with its own MCP server, and a SessionEnd that closed every Playwright browser
took the other sessions' browsers with it (measured 2026-08-18). The cleanup
hook therefore closes only what `is_owned_by(pid, session_pid())` proves
descends from *this* session's Claude process, plus true orphans -- browsers
whose MCP server has already exited and left them to launchd -- which no live
session can be using.
