"""PostToolUse hook: park Playwright browser windows out of the way.

Finds every Playwright-spawned browser window (verified through the process
ancestry, so hand-opened browsers are left alone) that is not already on the
scratch workspace, and moves it there -- i3 workspace 100-120 on Linux, the
`playwright` space on macOS. Windows that cannot be moved (yabai without its
scripting addition) are floated instead so they at least stop disturbing the
tiling layout.
